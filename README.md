# Reactor Experiments

We need to establish a concurrency architecture for building Tendermint in Rust,
but we need to experiment with different approaches to establish which will work
best for us.

This repository will eventually contain several proof-of-concept Rust programs
that will demonstrate different concurrency architectures/approaches.

See the [plaintext project](./.plaintext/README.md) for more details as to the
structure of the project, including milestones and deliverables. See also the
[report](./.plaintext/reports/001--concurrency-libs.md) for a summary of prior
desktop research relating to the project.
